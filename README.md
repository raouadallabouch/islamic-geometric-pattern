Islamic Star Pattern Ripple

An interactive visualization of the classic Islamic Star Pattern, featuring an aesthetic mouse ripple effect that distorts the geometry in real-time.

✨ Features

Interactive Art: A continuous Islamic Star pattern that reacts organically to your cursor.

Aesthetic Physics: Nodes use a Spring/Mass system to create a satisfying "ripple" distortion when touched.

Customizable: Adjust the star angles and physics parameters (friction, tension) to change the feel of the ripple.

Responsive: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile touch interaction.



🛠️ How it Works

This is not a static image, but a mathematical simulation. It uses Hankin's "Polygons in Contact" algorithm to draw the star pattern procedurally. The intersection points are treated as physical nodes suspended in a grid; when you move your mouse, you push these nodes, creating the fluid, organic ripple effect over the rigid geometric structure.
